## I. Core Angular Concepts Utilized/Needed:

1.  **Components:** The fundamental building blocks (Desktop, WindowFrame, Taskbar, individual Apps).
    *   `@Input()` and `@Output()`: For communication between parent/child components (e.g., `WindowFrameComponent` receiving `windowInstance` and emitting close requests).
    *   Lifecycle Hooks: `ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy` are crucial. `ngAfterViewInit` for DOM manipulations (like initial window positioning if not done via styles).
    *   `ViewChild`, `ViewContainerRef`: Essential for dynamic component creation (loading app content into `WindowFrameComponent`).
    *   Standalone Components: The modern approach, simplifying module management.
2.  **Services:** For shared logic and state management (`DesktopManagerService`, `AppRegistryService`, `FileSystemService`, `SettingsService`).
    *   Dependency Injection (DI): How services are provided and consumed.
    *   `providedIn: 'root'`: For singleton services.
3.  **RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript):**
    *   `Observable`: For streams of data (e.g., `windows$` in `DesktopManagerService`).
    *   `BehaviorSubject`: A type of Observable that holds the current value and emits it to new subscribers (perfect for service state).
    *   Operators: `map`, `switchMap`, `take`, `catchError`, `filter`, `debounceTime`, `throttleTime` (useful for optimizing event handling like dragging).
    *   `Subscription` management: Unsubscribing to prevent memory leaks (`ngOnDestroy`).
4.  **Dynamic Component Loading:**
    *   `createComponent()` (used with `ViewContainerRef`): The modern way to create component instances programmatically.
5.  **Modules (if not fully standalone at all levels):**
    *   `NgModule`: Understanding how they declare components, provide services, and import other modules (less critical if fully standalone, but good background).
6.  **Routing (`@angular/router`):**
    *   Even if the "OS" itself doesn't heavily use traditional page routing, the `iframe`-based browser app might use internal Angular routes for its "pages." Understanding `provideRouter` and `Routes` configuration.
7.  **Change Detection:**
    *   Understanding how Angular detects changes and updates the DOM.
    *   `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`: Can be used to optimize performance in components that only depend on their `@Input()`s changing.
    *   `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` / `markForCheck()`: Manually triggering change detection if needed (rarely, but sometimes useful with complex RxJS or external events).
8.  **Directives:**
    *   Attribute Directives: Could be used for behaviors like `appDraggable`, `appResizable` to encapsulate that logic.
    *   Structural Directives: `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`.
9.  **Pipes:** For data transformation in templates (e.g., `| date`, `| json`, custom pipes).
10. **Forms (`@angular/forms`):**
    *   Template-driven or Reactive Forms: Would be used in the `SettingsApp` or if your `CliApp` had more complex input, or if `TextPadApp` gets save dialogs.
11. **`HttpClient` (`@angular/common/http`):**
    *   For fetching external data (e.g., `contentPath` files from `assets`, or future API calls).
12. **Styling:**
    *   Component-scoped CSS/SCSS.
    *   Global styles (`styles.scss`).
    *   CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for theming.
    *   Flexbox & CSS Grid: For layout.
    *   CSS Positioning (`absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`) for windows and desktop items.
13. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Prerendering (`@angular/ssr`):**
    *   Understanding `PLATFORM_ID` and `isPlatformBrowser` for writing platform-agnostic code.
    *   How it impacts access to browser globals like `window` and `document`.
14. **`ngx-markdown` (or similar):** Understanding how third-party libraries integrate, especially those that interact with `HttpClient` or render complex content.

## II. Broader Software Engineering & OS Concepts (Inspiration & Application):

1.  **Operating System Concepts (High-Level Inspiration):**
    *   **Window Manager:** Z-ordering, focus management, window lifecycle (create, minimize, maximize, close), window decorations.
    *   **Desktop Environment:** The overall shell, taskbar, desktop icons, application launchers (Start Menu).
    *   **File System:** Hierarchical structure (folders, files), paths, file types, metadata. Analogy to `inode` tables for internal representation.
    *   **Processes/Applications:** Concept of distinct applications, single vs. multi-instance behavior.
    *   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) - Simulated:** How different parts of your "OS" (services, components) communicate events and data (primarily via RxJS and service method calls).
    *   **System Calls - Simulated:** Service methods acting as the API for applications to interact with the "kernel" (core services).
    *   **Shell / CLI:** Command parsing, command execution, input/output streams.
    *   **Event Loop (Browser's):** Understanding how JavaScript is single-threaded and handles asynchronous operations is crucial for UI responsiveness.
2.  **Design Patterns:**
    *   **Singleton:** Services are singletons.
    *   **Observer Pattern:** RxJS is heavily based on this (Observables and Subscribers).
    *   **Strategy Pattern:** Could be used for different behaviors (e.g., different file opening strategies based on type).
    *   **Facade Pattern:** Services often act as facades to more complex underlying logic.
    *   **Command Pattern:** Useful for implementing CLI commands or undo/redo functionality.
3.  **State Management:**
    *   Centralized state (in services using `BehaviorSubject`).
    *   Immutability (creating new state objects/arrays instead of mutating existing ones) to help with change detection and predictability.
    *   (Future) More advanced state libraries like NgRx/Akita if complexity grows significantly.
4.  **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Design:**
    *   Visual hierarchy, consistency, discoverability.
    *   Interaction design for draggable elements, menus, etc.
    *   Accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation – important future consideration).
5.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `Map`: Useful for registries (e.g., `appRegistry`, `fsObjects` in `FileSystemService`).
    *   Arrays: For lists of windows, files.
    *   Trees (Implicit): Your file system structure is a tree.
6.  **Asynchronous Programming:**
    *   Promises (less used with Angular's RxJS preference, but good to know).
    *   `async/await` (can be used with Observables via `firstValueFrom` or `lastValueFrom`).
7.  **Web APIs (Browser APIs):**
    *   `localStorage`: For persistence.
    *   DOM Manipulation (though Angular abstracts much of this, understanding it helps with directives or complex UI).
    *   `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`: For handling user input.
    *   `<iframe>`: For the browser app.
    *   HTML5 Canvas: For drawing or WASM apps.
8.  **WebAssembly (WASM):** (For future WASM app)
    *   Understanding how it works, the toolchain for a chosen language (C++, Rust), and JS-WASM interop.
9.  **TensorFlow.js (TF.js):** (For future AI app)
    *   Loading models, running inference, handling tensors, integrating with webcam/mic if needed.
10. **Version Control (Git):** Essential for any project.
11. **Modular Design & Separation of Concerns:** Breaking the system into manageable, independent (as much as possible) services and components.
